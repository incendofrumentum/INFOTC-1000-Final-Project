You open your eyes to find yourself in a drab, stone room. It seems like some kind of dungeon, but you don't remember entering anything like this.
The room is small, only housing the cot that you woke up upon, and a small camera in the corner with a red light blinking on it. The only other thing of note in the room is the __two doors__, leading to the _left_ and the _right_.

As you are coming to terms with your new enviroment, a voice comes booming from the walls.
>Welcome, subject 1438t5. I'm sure you must be a little confused right now. There is no need to be alarmed, if you listen to what I have to say, you will get out of here unharmed.  
>All you need to do is move through the different rooms and solve the puzzles within them. Do this, and you will be out of here in no time.
>Simply choose one of the two doors in this room, and you may begin. Good luck.
