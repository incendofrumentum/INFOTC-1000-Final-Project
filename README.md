# INFOTC-1000-Final-Project

This repository was created as my final project for the INFOTC 1000 class.  
It is a choose your adventure style of game. At the bottom of this document, there is a link that will take you to the opening area. From there you will have to solve puzzles to progress in the game.  
I understand that this isn't exactly what the project was designed to be, but I hope that it will be satisfactory. I will do my best to ensure that it contains all of the requirements described in the canvas document.

As stated above, this repo is styled as a choose your own adventure style of game. This is based off of the [choose your own adventure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choose_Your_Own_Adventure) books.  
In these books, you would read a short section of text, and then you would go to a specified page based on your choices.
Of course, this repo will not be as comprehensive as these books are, but the basic idea will remain the same.
You will read a short section of text, and then you will have to make a decision, clicking a link to take you to another page on the repo. Some options will lead to failure, and others will lead to victory.

As a final note before the game begins in earnest, this game will have branching paths and multiple endings.
Due to this, some of the requirements will only be fullfilled in certain paths. For example, based on decisions you make, you could miss the block of code.
I would ask that you try to see everything before grading this project.
Thank you.
