Having solved the puzzle, you enter into the final chamber.  
You know that it is the final chamber because of the large, neon sign that reads __FINAL CHAMBER__.

On another wall, there is some writing etched into the wall.

```python
  for letter in alphabet:
    print(alphabet[9])
```

Finally, upon closer inspection, you see that the letters on the neon sign can be pressed.
